To view/interact with the API, you'll need to run the swagger ui on the
same (local) host as app.go.

Use this url in your swagger ui 'explore' text box:

http://localhost:3000/apispec/api-docs/quote/quote.json

You can serve up the swagger ui on the mac by cloning the project, then
running starting a web service in the dist directory using
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
